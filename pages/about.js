    <p>
      As the first blog post for RunThatBall, I want to get some thoughts out of the way as to why
      I'm writing this blog and what I hope to accomplish. So first, let me introduce myself. My
      name is Steven Scaffidi. I'm born and raised in New Orleans (yes, I am a Saints fan), and I've
      been a life-long football; and in particular, I'm a fan of the rush game. I have an undergrad
      in math, and I'm a software developer by day. I hope I can use that combination of experience,
      skills, and love for football to talk about the rush game. Unlike the pass game though, the
      run game isn't particularly sexy or exciting, other than the couple of highlights we see after
      the game. However, I think there is more to run game when it comes to winning football games.
