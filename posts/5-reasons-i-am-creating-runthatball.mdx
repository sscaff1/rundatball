title: 5 Reasons I'm creating RunThatBall
---

## 3 types of blogs that will be featured on RunThatBall

### Stats - Lots of Stats

I love data. Data can help illustrate how the rush game contributes to a team's win/loss record. I'm not here to manipulate data, and I'm not here to prove my premise. I'm here to deliver objective, digestible data. I love data visualization so charts and other visual instruments will be used to communicate these stats to you. All other blog posts types that I talk about in the post will be heavily influenced by data.

### Individual Players

I want to answer a bunch of questions when it comes to individuals and how they contribute to their team. Beyond just the individual stats, I want to look at rush efficiency, and it's relationship to win percentage. Does it make sense to pay a running back (even someone like a Kamara or Henry)? How long does the average running back run effectively? Does a star running back really contribute to a team's win percentage? Where is the sweat spot in the draft to pick up a running back? I hope to put data around these questions and more.

### Historical

I want to look at the historical great teams and players. How has the run game changed over the decades? What did an efficient run game look like in 1970 vs 2020? What did the average playoff team look like in 1970 vs 2020? I'll be focusing primarily on the Superbowl error (although I will talk about some of the all-time greats like Jim Brown).

I will definitely be talking about other topics as this blog grows, but I hope this article serves as the purpose of this blog. Until next-time, run that ball.
