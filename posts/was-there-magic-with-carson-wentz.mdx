title: Was there ever magic with Carson Wentz in 2017?

The 2017 Philidelphia Eagles team went 13-3 in the regular season and beat a Tom Brady led 13-3 New England team in the Superbowl. The star quarterback for most of the season was Carson Wentz. Yet, Wentz didn't lead the team to their Superbowl win. Wentz tore his ACL during a week 14 Monday Night Football matchup. Typically, losing your star quarterback results in a big downturn in your team's performance. But that didn't happen. Nick Foles took over for Wentz, finished out the season and won the Superbowl. Since that 2017 season, Wentz's performance has gone downhill. Teams have attempted to rekindle the magic of that 2017 season, but it has been a failure. So the questions become: Why were the 2017 Philidelphia Eagles that good? Was Wentz actually magical that season? Were there other factors that contributed to the success of the quarterback position?

Concluding the 2017 season, Wentz finsihed with highest QBR in the league. He would have finished first in passing touchdowns and likely would have won the league MVP. But, two stats from that season stand out to me. First, Wentz finished 25th in completion percentage that year. That had me wonder: when was the last time a league MVP finished 25th in completion percentage? Well, the answer is Cam Newton in 2015. However, Cam also had 10 rushing TDs that year. Adding to the confusion, Wentz finished first in TDs per completion. So let me break this down with some data.

Second, the Eagles finished with only 9 rushing TDs that season. To put that into perspective, that's less than the 10 TDs they scored in 2012. In 2012, the Eagles finished 4-12 and dead last in the NFC (yes even below the Lions). Despite the abysmal number of rushing TDs, the Eagles still managed to finish 3rd in rushing yards. Do you see where I'm going? I'm not saying throwing TDs passes is easy, but the rushing attack was moving the team down the field. Wentz that season was akin to a forward in soccer standing slightly onsides and the perfect passes kept coming. In other words, he is and always has been a medociare QB who got lucky in 2017. 

When the Washington Commanders take the field this season, I'm expecting the same old average Wentz to take the field and provide them average performances. He's not worth the money. He's not a long term solution to your franchise QB problem. Let 2017 and move on.
