The 2017 Philadelphia Eagles team went 13-3 in the regular season. They beat a Tom Brady led 13-3 New England team in the Superbowl. The star quarterback for most of the season was Carson Wentz, however he didn't lead the team to their Superbowl win. He tore his ACL during the week 14 Monday Night Football matchup. Typically losing the star quarterback results in a big downturn in the team's performance. But that didn't happen. Nick Foles took over for Wentz, finished out the season and won the Superbowl. Since that 2017 season, Wentz's performance has gone downhill. Philadelphia and Indianapolis have attempted to rekindle the magic of that 2017 season, but have not seem the same success. So, why were the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles that good? Was Wentz actually magical that season? Were there other factors that contributed to the success of the quarterback position?

Concluding the 2017 season, Wentz finished with the highest QBR in the league. He would have finished first in passing touchdowns and likely would have won the league MVP. Two stats from that season stand out to me. First, Wentz finished 25th in completion percentage that year. When was the last time a league MVP finished 25th in completion percentage? During Cam Newton's 2015 MVP season, he ranked 27th in completion percentage. Newton wasn't the typical QB MVP. He had almost 650 yards rushing and 10 rushing TDs in addition to 35 passing TDs. Beyond Newton's 2015 season, no QB MVP has ever ranked lower than 20th in the NFL. Despite the relatively low completion percentage, Wentz finished first in TDs per attempt. As the chart below illustrates, those stats are extremely rare. Since 1957, we've had 45 QB MVPs. Of those 45, all but 3 rank in the top 50% for both TDs per attempt and completion percentage.

Second, the Eagles finished with only 9 rushing TDs that season. To put that into perspective, that's less than the 10 TDs they scored in 2012. In 2012, the Eagles finished 4-12 and dead last in the NFC (yes even below the Lions). Despite the abysmal number of rushing TDs, the Eagles still managed to finish 3rd in rushing yards. So the rushing attack moved them down the field and Wentz was able to cash-in. That allowed Wentz to finish that season with highest TD per pass attempt in 2017. In other words, his numbers on the surface appear better than his actual performance. Wentz has always been a mediocre QB. In 2017, the magic formula was the Eagles rushing attack, it was never Wentz.

When the Washington Commanders take the field this season, I'm expecting the same old average Wentz. Looking at the data, he's not worth the money and not a long term solution to the franchise QB problem. Overall, the chart shows that the 2017 magic never existed.

## Other notes

The chart above ranks QBs who threw 200 or more passes that year. Since 1957, all QB MVPs threw over 200 passes. I chose to compare ranking in these categories vs the actual statics because of how much the rules have changed over the decades. I will likely followup with a post on passing stats through the decades. Comparing actual stats wouldn't actual be fair to QBs of the past.
