# 2022 season over/under predictions for every NFL team

Below are my predictions for every NFL team vs their over/under win total. Win totals are from September 8th, 2022 according to DraftKings. In addition, I put a confidence rating on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the most confident in that theoritical bet. At the end of the season, I'll have a visual of how I did. This does not disclose my actual bets just my feelings about how the teams compare to their Vegas win totals.
