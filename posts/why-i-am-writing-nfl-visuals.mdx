Welcome to NFL Visuals. This is my first blog post, and I hope that you find this blog fun, insightful, and useful. Here are the main reasons I've decided to embark on this journey.

### Fun

I created NFL visuals first and foremost for fun. I love the game of football, and I wanted to create a way to visualize the data. I wanted to be able to sit down on Tuesday morning visualize how teams are trending (especially the Saints). I wanted to compare teams and be able to more accurately predict who could be playoff bound based on data. I wanted to bring these things together with web-based mobile-friendly charts that you can access anywhere with no hoops to jump through. Looking at stats in tables on [ESPN](https://espn.com) or [SI](https://si.com) is not fun and it's not informative. My goal is to atleast give context with every chart on the site. That's why if you check out my [team charts](/team-charts) you'll notice that I give some context to the data. I tell you who has made the playoffs, what conference rank they came in, how they compare to other teams, and how the team has been trending over the last few years.

### Insightful

I pull different data together to help you understand the outcomes a team's performance. Who cares if your team lead the league in passing if it doesn't translate to a playoff berth? Why did that happen? My charts help you answer these questions and make better predictions about a team's playoff potential. Without context, data is boring. My goal is to help tell a story using the data. I'll be pulling out insightful information, pairing it with visual data, and hopefully telling you something you didn't know before.

### Useful

Are you ever watching Sunday games and quickly want to know what team is leading the league in rushing? What about in 2017? Sure, you can Google this information. Or you can quickly pull up [team charts](/team-charts) on your phone and not only see who leads the league, but also, how your team compares. NFL Visuals will always be easily accessible and mobile-friendly (even our charts). Data visuals can help see things you may have missed on the surface. If you have any feedback or something you'd like me to investigate, drop me a line at [steven@nflvisuals.com](mailto:steven@nflvisuals.com), and I'll do my best to pull something together.
