So I'm listening to CBS sports radio one day, and the host is talking about Deshaun Watson's move to the Cleveland Browns. Early in the trade process, Watson had eliminated Cleveland as a possible landing spot. The radio host stated that Watson originally eliminated Cleveland because it would negatively affect his stats as QB. This made me wonder if there was any truth to this opinion. Aaron Rodgers won the 2020 and 2021 NFL MVP, and he plays in one of the harshest environments in the NFL. Tom Brady has played all of his career in an outdoor stadium. On the other hand, you have games like 2021 New England Patriots at Buffalo Bills where Mac Jones threw 3 total passes. On the whole though, does playing outside negatively affect QB stats in a significant way? If a QB has a home indoor stadium, does his performance go down playing outside? Is the opposite true? In this post, I'll try to answer these questions by putting some data around it.

First, let's set some ground rules. I'm going to be looking at QB performance for the last 20 years. I'm going to consider retractable roof indoor stadiums since those stadiums are largely shielded from the elements. I'm going to remove games in Europe and Mexico from this analysis. In 2021, 20 stadiums in the NFL are open while 10 have either a retractable roof or dome. Here is how the stadiums break down by week/year:
